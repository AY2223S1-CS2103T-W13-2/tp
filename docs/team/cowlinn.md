### Project: LongTimeNoSee(LTNS)

Long Time No See (LTNS) is a desktop task tracking app made for student financial advisors to manage their contact base and stay connected with their clients. Made simpler with an intuitive and minimalistic graphical user interface (GUI) and customised functionalities to pinpoint your needs, LTNS will enable you to stay close to your dearest clients!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the main representation of our user's patrons, i.e: The `client` class.
  * Justification: This feature is required to use our application.
  * Highlights:  It encapsulates extensions from the original AB3's person model. You can store birthdays, add income, RiskAppetite levels etc.
  * Credits: `LocalDate` Library of Java: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html


* **New Feature**: Added a new `Event` model to encapsulate meetings a  Financial Advisor wll have with clients.
  * Justification: This feature is one of the new models of the application
  * Highlights: Meetings with a client are recording as an `Event`. Includes a `Description` and a day with start and end time.
    * Used by Reuben to make the `calendar` feature of the app.
