### Project: LongTimeNoSee(LTNS)

Long Time No See (LTNS) is a desktop task tracking app made for student financial advisors to manage their contact base and stay connected with their clients. Made simpler with an intuitive and minimalistic graphical user interface (GUI) and customised functionalities to pinpoint your needs, LTNS will enable you to stay close to your dearest clients!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the main representation of our user's patrons, i.e: The `client` class.
  * Justification: This feature is required to use our code
  * Highlights:  It encapsulates extensions from the original AB3's person model. You can store birthdays, add notes, tag people etc.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=cowlinn&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other]()
